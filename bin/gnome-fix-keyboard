# Avoid a bug on Gnome 3.36.3 (at least on Ubuntu/Pop OS) where it won't apply
# keyboard accessibility settings on startup. 
#
# Custom user settings are correctly recorded in gsettings but due to the
# bug Gnome applies the default values.  This script simulates dragging the
# sliders manually in the GUI to any position and then dragging them back to
# their previous position. The bug also happens when logging out / logging in.
#
# Register this script on Startup Application Preferences.

# Avoid timing issues with a sleep. Without this, the settings
# won't get applied correctly.
